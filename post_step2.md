# Step 2 Summary — Per-Body Solve & Warm Starting

## Completed Work
- Documented the per-body AVBD update process (force/Hessian assembly, LDLᵀ solve, quaternion increment) and linked it to Rapier’s rigid-body data model in `docs/avbd_per_body_solve.md` for downstream implementation work.
- Captured the warm-start schedule, recommended α/β/γ defaults, and the rationale for scaling stored duals to avoid reintroducing constraint error energy.
- Enumerated the persistent caches and per-iteration scratch space the solver will require so memory-management planning can begin alongside feature-flag integration.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to roadmap Step 3 by cataloging constraint energy patterns from the Houdini reference implementation and the 2D demo, translating them into 3D-ready constraint builders and color-bucket planning guidance.
- Start sketching how Rapier’s existing constraint graph and contact manifolds will supply the AVBD workspace structures defined in Step 2.
