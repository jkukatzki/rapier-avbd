Goal is to create an alternative physics solver in the rapier library. Instead of a sequential impulse based solution we are trying to implement the Augmented Vertex Block Descent method in an efficient way in rust. Read through all relevant files in the llm_digests folder to get an overview of the project and what parallelization tricks could be utilized and improvements lined out in the paper could be modelled appropriately while still maintaining compatibility for all platforms. We have a test benchmark for the js build output which you can utilize as a build test pipeline and benchmark against the default rapier implementation. Make sure simulation method agnostic things like step rate is the same amongst the two.
