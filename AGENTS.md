DO NOT BUILD IN SANDBOX, LET USER BUILD THE PROJECT AND THEN WORK WITH USER REPORTED OUTCOME. CARGO CHECK IS FINE.
Goal is to create an alternative physics solver in the rapier library. Instead of a sequential impulse based solution we are trying to implement the Augmented Vertex Block Descent method in an efficient way in rust. Read through all relevant files in the llm_digests folder to get an overview of the project and what parallelization tricks could be utilized and improvements lined out in the paper could be modelled appropriately while still maintaining compatibility for all platforms. We need benchmarks integrated in our rust tests and also deviation detection from our normal simulation, and basic things like spawning rigid bodies, falling on a ground and not having a negative up coordinate after. Make sure simulation method agnostic things like step rate is the same amongst the two benchmark comparisons and prepare the methods broken down on a mathematical level (use the same nalgebra crate as rapier) and then at a technical level for parallelisation with whatever methods possible for a wasm target and keeping this architecture in mind when planning for color buckets of energy distributions so determinism is ensured. 
There should be a basic demo wrapped as a .html file utilizing the rapier package to spawn colliders in a world and update threejs instancedmesh objects representing the colliders to display them in a canvas. there should be an easy script to either use the locally imported wasm or the normal npm rapier import. the syntax to use them should be the exact same. only the solver should act differently.
