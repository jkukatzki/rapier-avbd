# Step 4 Summary — Workspace Staging & Build Integration

## Completed Work
- Staged AVBD solver state in a reusable workspace, added scratch buffers, and exposed a read-only body set so constraints operate on cached poses instead of mutating `RigidBodySet` in place.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L14-L223】【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/workspace.rs†L1-L77】
- Expanded the AVBD test suite with plane-contact, determinism, and impulse-comparison checks to guard regression risk while validating the staged solver behaviour.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L340-L679】
- Documented the wasm/Three.js demo pipeline and added feature-aware publishing scripts so AVBD builds can toggle between local and npm WebAssembly artefacts without API changes.【F:assets/avbd_three_demo.html†L1-L189】【F:scripts/publish-rapier.sh†L1-L40】【F:publish-all.sh†L1-L14】

## Next Steps
- Thread the staged AVBD solver through Rapier’s island solver to replace the PGS backend when the feature flag is enabled, including contact/joint builders that populate the new workspace directly.
- Pool constraint structures (contacts, joints, motors) alongside the staged bodies to minimise allocation churn and prepare for color-bucket parallelism noted in the digests.
- Capture deterministic benchmark baselines so the new integration tests can compare against reference impulse data without embedding heuristic tolerances.
