# Step 4 Summary — Workspace Staging & Build Integration

## Completed Work
- Staged AVBD solver state in a reusable workspace, added scratch buffers, and exposed a read-only body set so constraints operate on cached poses instead of mutating `RigidBodySet` in place.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L15-L283】【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/workspace.rs†L1-L78】
- Expanded the AVBD test suite with plane-contact, determinism, and impulse-comparison checks to guard regression risk while validating the staged solver behaviour.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L427-L679】
- Documented the wasm/Three.js demo pipeline and added feature-aware publishing scripts so AVBD builds can toggle between local and npm WebAssembly artefacts without API changes.【F:assets/avbd_three_demo.html†L1-L189】【F:scripts/publish-rapier.sh†L1-L40】【F:publish-all.sh†L1-L14】

## Alignment with Caveats Digest
- The staged workspace and read-only `AvbdBodySet` directly address the earlier caveat about staging per-body buffers before parallelising colour buckets, giving us the body view recommended for subsequent caching passes.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L15-L283】【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/workspace.rs†L1-L78】【F:llm_digests/first_attempt_caveats_digest.txt†L16-L30】
- The new regression tests and feature-aware tooling focus the next iteration on trimming recompute costs and preserving determinism, echoing the caveats digest guidance about benchmarking and solver overhead.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L427-L679】【F:llm_digests/first_attempt_caveats_digest.txt†L1-L27】

## Next Steps
- Thread the staged AVBD solver through Rapier’s island solver so contact and joint builders populate the workspace directly, matching the digest’s call for per-island writeback before pursuing parallelism.【F:llm_digests/first_attempt_caveats_digest.txt†L16-L27】
- Pool constraint structures (contacts, joints, motors) and cache their gradients/Jacobians to eliminate the per-iteration recompute overhead that the digest flagged.【F:llm_digests/first_attempt_caveats_digest.txt†L1-L13】【F:llm_digests/first_attempt_caveats_digest.txt†L25-L27】
- Capture deterministic benchmark baselines and iterate on stiffness decay so we can measure the impact of the planned colour-bucket parallelism without heuristic tolerances.【F:llm_digests/first_attempt_caveats_digest.txt†L5-L13】
