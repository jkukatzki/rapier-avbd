## Phase 1: ???

## Phase 2: Core Solver Scaffolding
- [ ] Implement Rust module scaffolding for AVBD solver with placeholder algorithms, integrating with existing step pipeline hooks.
  - Added an `AvbdIslandSolver` shim that collects contact and joint handles into placeholder constraints and dispatches the solver during island processing.【F:src/dynamics/solver/island_solver.rs†L1-L222】
- [ ] Establish optional compilation path conditioned on the AVBD feature flag and ensure legacy solver is excluded in that configuration.
  - Feature gating now removes the legacy velocity solver when `solver_impulse` is disabled and emits a compile-time error if no solver backend is selected.【F:src/dynamics/solver/mod.rs†L1-L36】【F:src/dynamics/integration_parameters.rs†L36-L71】
- [ ] Write initial unit tests covering solver selection logic and compile-time feature enforcement.
  - Added coverage for the AVBD dispatcher and solver interface with bespoke tests exercising the new placeholder path.【F:src/dynamics/solver/island_solver.rs†L192-L222】【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L300-L417】

## Phase 3: Algorithm Implementation
- [ ] Implement primal AVBD iteration (vertex block updates, constraint projection) using nalgebra structures.
  - Constraint processing now reuses solver workspace buffers to evaluate gradients, Hessians, and block mass inverses per body, applying projection updates per iteration.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L70-L196】
- [ ] Add augmented Lagrangian dual updates and stiffness escalation controls.
  - Lambda relaxation, stiffness decay/warm-start, and per-iteration growth follow the AVBD parameterization with configurable clamps.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L98-L164】【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L206-L230】
- [ ] Introduce color bucket partitioning and parallel execution scaffolding (Rayon/parallel iterators or existing Rapier threadpool hooks).
  - Solver workspace builds conflict-free constraint buckets and retains per-body color usage so future parallel passes can dispatch buckets safely.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L232-L318】
- [ ] Validate solver stability against baseline scenarios with integration tests.
  - Added regression tests covering convergence, coloring, and augmented stiffness growth to guard the implementation trajectory.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L420-L496】

## Phase 4: Performance & Memory Strategy
- [ ] Profile memory usage patterns and implement pooled buffers / arena allocators optimized for AVBD iterations.
  - `SolverWorkspace::initialize` now reserves body, map, and bucket storage based on island demands to avoid churn during hot loops.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L212-L248】
  - Constraint scratch buffers reuse internal vectors and pre-reserve index capacity once per frame, limiting per-constraint allocations.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L356-L381】
- [ ] Tune cache-friendly data layouts (SoA where beneficial) and ensure minimal allocations per step.
  - Distance scenes exercise the solver with deterministic helper routines that keep gradients/minv buffers densely packed for sequential or future batched dispatch.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L577-L702】
  - Warm-start assembly reuses the same buffer layout as the main iteration, eliminating redundant gradient recomputation overhead.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L134-L197】
- [ ] Integrate instrumentation hooks for benchmarking (timers, iteration counters) exposed to Rust and JS.
  - Added `AvbdSolveReport` and `AvbdSolver::take_report` to expose iteration counts, warm-start usage, and wall-clock timings for downstream benchmarking surfaces.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/solver.rs†L20-L116】
