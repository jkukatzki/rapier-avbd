# Step 1 Summary — AVBD Mathematical Foundation

## Completed Work
- Surveyed the AVBD paper digest passages outlining the original VBD energy minimization problem, the augmented Lagrangian dual update, and the progressive stiffness schedules for both hard and finite constraints.
- Documented the core equations, stability mechanisms, and iteration structure in `docs/avbd_math_brief.md` so downstream modeling tasks have a single reference point.
- Recorded planning progress and captured the relevant stability considerations (SPD Hessian approximation, constraint error damping, warm-start scaling) for later workspace and implementation design.

## Next Steps
- Step 2 from the roadmap: document per-body solve equations and warm-start parameters (α, β, γ), producing reference notes that will guide solver workspace design and code comments.
- Begin mapping constraint energy types from existing AVBD implementations (Houdini repo, 2D demo) once Step 2 is complete, aligning with the roadmap’s subsequent research tasks.
