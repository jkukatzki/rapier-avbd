# Step 1 Planning â€” AVBD Mathematical Foundation

## Objectives
- Capture the augmented Lagrangian formulation that differentiates AVBD from legacy VBD/PGS approaches.
- Identify the equations governing the primal solve, dual updates, and stiffness scheduling so they can inform future modeling work.
- Produce a concise internal math brief that the implementation team can reference during subsequent roadmap steps.

## Task Checklist
- [x] Review the AVBD paper digest passages that describe the VBD baseline and augmented Lagrangian extension.
- [x] Extract the core equations for the primal vertex solve, dual variable updates, and stiffness growth.
- [x] Summarize the stability-enhancing techniques (SPD Hessian approximation, error damping, warm starting).
- [x] Draft the initial AVBD math brief capturing these findings with citations to the digest resources.

## Progress Log
- Initialized plan for Step 1 focused on digesting the mathematical foundations described in the roadmap.
- Collected roadmap-referenced excerpts covering VBD energy minimization, augmented Lagrangian updates, and stiffness scheduling from the AVBD paper digest.
- Captured stability notes (SPD Hessian approximation, constraint error damping, warm-start scaling) to feed into later implementation design.
- Authored the Step 1 math brief summarizing these findings with direct citations for future reference.
