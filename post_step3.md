# Step 3 Summary — Constraint Pattern Catalog

## Completed Work
- Collected the Houdini AVBD references for energy variants, adaptive stiffness handling, and 6×6 rigid solves, recording the findings in the Step 3 planning log and the new constraint catalog document.【F:pre_step3.md†L13-L20】【F:docs/avbd_constraint_catalog.md†L1-L20】
- Documented the AVBD 2D demo’s Force hierarchy, constraint-specific buffers, and solver parameters to guide 3D-ready builder design within Rapier.【F:docs/avbd_constraint_catalog.md†L22-L42】
- Outlined Rapier integration considerations tying the cataloged constraints to existing contact and joint modules for future implementation work.【F:docs/avbd_constraint_catalog.md†L44-L52】

## Next Steps
- Advance to roadmap Step 4 by reviewing the first-attempt caveats digest and capturing architecture anti-patterns before drafting workspace refactors.
- Begin sketching how pooled constraint workspaces and color-bucket execution will integrate with Rapier’s island solver as we translate the catalog into code.
