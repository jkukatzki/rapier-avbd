# Step 5 Summary — Island Integration & Constraint Pooling

## Summary
- Gated the legacy PGS solver behind feature-aware module attributes while keeping its public API surface available, preventing unused-code warnings when `solver_avbd` is enabled.【F:src/dynamics/solver/mod.rs†L1-L52】
- Moved `MotorParameters` into a shared solver module and added a geometry re-export for `ContactManifoldExt`, allowing the AVBD drop tests to compile using the stable public API paths.【F:src/dynamics/solver/motor_parameters.rs†L1-L21】【F:src/geometry/mod.rs†L1-L26】
- Updated the AVBD integration tests to use accessor methods, capture outcomes by value, and silence unused handles, then verified `cargo check --all-targets --features solver_avbd` succeeds.【F:src/dynamics/solver/avbd/tests.rs†L1-L135】【7ebf56†L1-L2】

## Next steps
- Extend the AVBD constraint pooling to cover joint constraints and reinstate warm-start writeback for joint manifolds.
- Flesh out feature-gated build scripts and benchmarks so the AVBD solver can run end-to-end comparisons against the legacy solver across the paper's parameter sweep.
- Implement 2D coverage for the AVBD integration tests and add determinism checks for jointed scenes once the joint solver path lands.
